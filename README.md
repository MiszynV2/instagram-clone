<h1 align="center">React Instagram Clone</h1>

Welcome to the React Instagram Clone project! This undertaking aims to elevate my programming skills by constructing a replica of the popular social media platform, Instagram, utilizing React. Through this project, I've honed my proficiency in React, Redux (if applicable), styling, API integration, and more. Engaging in this project provides valuable experience in developing a front-end application from the ground up, simulating real-world software development.

## Features I would like to add in the future 
- **Performance upgrade:** When images are loading website become too slow 
- **Adding comments functionality** 
- **Adding followers functionality**
